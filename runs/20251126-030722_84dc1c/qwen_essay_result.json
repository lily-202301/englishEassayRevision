  "original_text": "We sat down next to each other, but David wouldn't look at me. He lowered his head what he was thinking. I had high hopes for him so I wanted to let him join the cross-country. I comforted him in a soothing voice: \"you have work so hard for this event. I hope your work hard is rewarding, I will support you forever.\" My words like a warm stream rushed his being. David raised his eyes meet my eyes with his eyes sparkling with confident. David felt inspired. I was pleased beyond description that I can light his strong determination. David was thinking for a while, \"I hope I can try it.\" He laughed, his eyes shining with excitement. I pulled him into my arms, \"I believe you can do it.\" I watched as David moved up to the starting line with the other runners. But David still had butterflies in his stomach and his hands were sweaty. With starting competition. So nervous was him that he was slow.",
