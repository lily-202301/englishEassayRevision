  "original_text": "We sat down next to each other, but David wouldn't look at me. He lowered his head what he was thinking. I had high hopes for him so I wanted to let him join the cross-country. I comforted him in a soothing voice, \"you have work so hard for this event. I hope your work hard is rewarding, I will support you forever.\" My words like a warm stream rushed his being. David raised his eyes meet my eyes with his eyes sparkling with confident. David felt inspired. I was pleased beyond description that I can light his strong determination. David was thinking for a while, \"I hope I can try it.\" He laughed, his eyes shining with excitement. I pulled him into my arms, \"I believe you can do it.\" I watched as David moved up to the starting line with the other runners. But David still had butterflies in his stomach and his hands were sweaty. With starting competition. So nervous was him that he was slow.",

I was overjoyed to see that I had ignited his inner strength.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, David whispered, 'I hope I can try it.' A smile broke across his face, his eyes shining with excitement. I pulled him into my arms and said, 'I believe you can do it.' As the race began, David stood at the starting line with the others. Yet his hands trembled with sweat, and his heart pounded with anxiety. So nervous was he that he started slowly, but he didn’t give up. With every step, he pushed forward, determined to finish. And when he crossed the line, though last, he received thunderous applause — not just for finishing, but for the courage it took to begin."
