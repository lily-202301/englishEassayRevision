  "original_text": "We sat down next to each other, but David wouldn't look at me. He lowered his head what he was thinking. I had high hopes for him so I wanted to let him join the cross-country. I comforted him in a soothing voice, \"you have work so hard for this event. I hope your work hard is rewarding, I will support you forever.\" My words like a warm stream rushed his being. David raised his eyes meet my eyes with his eyes sparkling with confident. David felt inspired. I was pleased beyond description that I can light his strong determination. David was thinking for a while, \"I hope I can try it.\" He laughed, his eyes shining with excitement. I pulled him into my arms, \"I believe you can do it.\" I watched as David moved up to the starting line with the other runners. But David still had butterflies in his stomach and his hands were sweaty. With starting competition. So nervous was him that he was slow.",

I had always believed in his potential and hoped he would take part in the cross-country race. I comforted him in a soothing voice, 'You’ve worked so hard for this moment. I truly believe your dedication will be rewarded, and I’ll support you every step of the way.' My words flowed like a warm stream, touching his soul. David raised his eyes to meet mine, his gaze sparkling with newfound confidence. He felt inspired. I was overwhelmed with joy, knowing I had ignited the spark of courage within him.\n\nAfter a long pause, David whispered, 'I hope I can try it.' A smile broke across his face, his eyes shining with excitement. I pulled him into my arms and said, 'I believe you can do it.' As he moved up to the starting line with the other runners, his heart pounded like a drum, and his palms grew clammy with nerves. Yet, despite the fear, he stood tall, ready to face the challenge. The race began, and though he started slowly, each step forward was a victory. In that moment, I saw not just a runner—but a warrior of spirit and determination."
