  "original_text": "We sat down next to each other, but David wouldn't look at me. David towed his head, filling with badness and stared at track and field with a desiring eyes. I walked forward to him and patted his shoulder softly and said with a gentle tone, \"Why don't you try it? I know your grade and you are remarkable. I think you can try it and I believe you can finish it.\" David was surprised, showing his usual big toothy smile on his face when he heard my words. The instant, he decided to take part in this event, following his own heart although he couldn't take prize at last. Then, he signed up for this big cross-country run and walked toward the starting line with the other runners.\n\nI watched as David moved up to the starting line with the other runners. David's eyes were filled with confidence and light but fixed a frintament for this run. I called him with a loud voice and said to him with a strong voice, \"Come up! I believe that you can!\" The exciting competition stared. He ran hardly although other runners passed him a lot and he didn't give up. He ran with his sweats flowed from his face. At last, he finished this event and he walked toward me, hugging me with his eyes filled with appreciated tears. This experience made me and David that nothing is impossible, and we would never forget it.",
